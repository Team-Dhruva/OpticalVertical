> Contributors: Vinay, Shashank, Shrish, Srujan

AN300 is the 6 - inch Newtonian telescope designed and developed by our team. 6 -inch is the diameter of the telescope's parabolic primary mirror which is a f/4.5 mirror. The primary mirror cell was constructed using PLA 3D prints along with an acrylic base plate. THe optical tubing was made using a PVC pipe and a secondary mirror was attached using steel web attached to a 3D printed joint. This telescope is designed in such a way that it can produce a maximum of 300x magnification.
