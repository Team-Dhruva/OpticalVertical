## 1. AN300: 6-Inch Newtonian Optical Telescope

> **Contributors**: Vinay, Shashank, Shrish, Srujan

AN300 is a 6-inch Newtonian telescope designed and developed by our team. The 6-inch refers to the diameter of the telescope's parabolic primary mirror (f/4.5). The mirror cell was constructed using PLA 3D prints with an acrylic base plate. The optical tubing was made from a PVC pipe, and the secondary mirror is mounted using a steel spider web connected to a 3D printed joint. The telescope is capable of achieving up to 300× magnification.

### 1.1 Objectives

- Build a fully automated telescope using a 6-inch primary mirror.
- Design and integrate a motorized Dobsonian (alt-azimuth) mount for accurate celestial tracking.
- Implement Go-To functionality for automated object targeting and navigation.
- Develop remote control capabilities using software or mobile applications.
- Ensure high-quality optical alignment (collimation) and minimal aberrations.
- Integrate a CCD or CMOS camera system for astrophotography and data acquisition.
- Enable live streaming or real-time observation for educational and outreach purposes.
- Design the system for modularity and future upgrades (e.g., spectrometers).
- Document the full design, assembly, and testing process for reproducibility and learning.

### 1.2 Features

- 6-inch parabolic f/4.5 primary mirror  
- Up to 300× magnification  
- Astrophotography ready

### 1.3 Outcomes

Astrophotography involves capturing images of celestial bodies such as stars and planets using long-exposure techniques and specialized optics. As part of the Optical Vertical, our focus is on developing hardware and software for sky imaging, planetary photography, and time-lapse tracking. A Raspberry Pi camera module and image stacking techniques are used to produce high-resolution images for both research and outreach.

### 2.1 Objectives

- Capture high-resolution images of celestial objects including planets, stars, nebulae, and galaxies.
- Design a stable imaging setup integrated with the telescope system.
- Implement precise tracking for long-exposure imaging.
- Develop an image processing pipeline with stacking, calibration, and enhancement.
- Catalog and document observations for educational purposes.
- Train team members in field imaging and post-processing.
- Build a repository of astrophotography content for outreach and exhibitions.

### 2.2 Features

- Raspberry Pi camera module  
- Custom image stacking and processing algorithm  
- Module for live-streaming celestial events

### 2.3 Outcomes

- Successfully livestreamed the occultation of Antares.
- Captured and stacked high-resolution images of the Moon.
- Developed scripts to control camera properties such as ISO and shutter speed.

### 2.4 Future Work

- Upgrade to a higher-resolution camera sensor.
- Develop a tracking algorithm based on real-time image input.
- Integrate the camera module with the automated telescope system.

## 3. Adaptive Optics Research

> **Contributors**: Snigdha, Pranjal, Sanketh, Anushka, Aryan A., Srujan

This project explores the application of Adaptive Optics (AO) in ground-based astronomy to enhance image quality by correcting atmospheric distortion. The focus is on modeling the effects of key AO system parameters on starfield imaging performance across different zenith angles. A controlled simulation framework is used to study the impact of turbulence, forming a foundation for experimental and real-time AO systems.

### 3.1 Objectives

- Model the influence of AO system parameters (e.g., actuator count, correction frequency) on image quality.
- Simulate atmospheric turbulence at varying zenith angles.
- Evaluate AO performance based on image sharpness, Strehl ratio, and PSF (point spread function).
- Develop a modular simulation framework for AO testing.
- Prepare for future experimental validation and AO integration with telescopes.
